# Overview
"Fi Melior” is a classic, fast paced, Action, role playing game. Set in a Dungeon, the
game lets the user traverse through rooms, kill enemies, and loot chests. Similar to the dungeons
of other popular RPGs (like Elden Ring and Skyrim), “Fi Melior” employs many tropes users
will recognize. The game focuses on a real time combat gameplay loop, in a preconceived map.
From the game mechanics, to art and controls, “Fi Melior” mixes the familiar gameplay of the
RPG genre in a new and exciting world.
